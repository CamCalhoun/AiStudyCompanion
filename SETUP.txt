INSTALL GUIDE
-------------

1. Extract the contents of the AiStudyCompanion/ zip file.

NOTE: The rest of this tutorial will assume that you are working with this file structure:
AiStudyCompanion/ASC/

2. Navigate to the folder AiStudyCompanion/ASC/

3. Open your terminal in this directory. With Node.js and npm installed, run:
	npm install
	
	If this is successful, you should see some packages added.
	npm will throw a warning about vulnerable packages, you can disregard this.
	These packages are not used in our program, but come bundled with some of the other utilities, so they are safe.

4. Navigate to the folder AiStudyCompanion/ASC/server

5. Create a python virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   This command reads:
		python, make, a virtual environment, named venv

6. Activate the virtual environment:
   This is where we will install our python packages.
   This command is slightly different based on your operating system.

   Windows:
   		venv/Scripts/activate
   Mac/Linux:
   		source venv/bin/activate
	
   You will know this has worked by some marker appearing in your command line
   that signifies you are in a virtual environment. For me, this is the string
   (venv) read before my directory line.

7. Install python dependencies
   With your virtual environment activated, run this command:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This will install dependencies from the requirements.txt file

8. Acquire an OPENAI Api key.
   IMPORTANT!
   For the sake of this demo, a temporary API Key has been provided.
   This can be found in the .env file.

   Please note:
   This key will expire some time after graduation. This is purely provided for demo purposes.
   If you wish to use ASC independently after our graduation, you will need to source an API key from OpenAI
   Then, replace the .env file provided with one of your own.
   Inside of .env the contents should be the following:
   OPENAI_API_KEY = <API_KEY>

9. Run the website:
   There are two steps to run the website.

   1. Run the frontend
	a. Navigate to: AiStudyCompanion/ASC/
	b. Run the command: npm run dev
	c. Click on the local host link provided

   2. Run the backend
	a. IN A SEPERATE TERMINAL INSTANCE
	   Navigate to: AiStudyCompanion/ASC/server
	b. Activate your virtual environment ( see step 6 for help )
	c. Run the command: uvicorn main:app --reload

You should now have ASC running in your browser window.
