  <h1>Week 3</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This second week of the project was focused primarily on OpenAI API Integration, and developing a working demo for this integration. We first obtained tokens for communicating with the AI model. These are spent with each message sent and received. Limits were set on the amount of there tokens used, as well as monetary monthly limits on OpenAI. To communicate with the AI model, we must make requests through an API. This meant we had to develop a way to store our API keys. This was done through the python-dotenv library, and making use of .env files. This hides the API key from the project itself, and makes the key secure. If we were to expose our API key to the web, our tokens could be used by malicious, outside users, and our wallets drained. The rest of the time this week was spent developing our communication with the AI model, and developing a simple chat bot we can communicate with. This will allow easy integration of features in the program that require communicating with the AI model.</p>

      <li>AI tokens acquired</li>

  <h1>Week 4</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This week our focus was directed towards developing the User and Subject classes, and using them to interact with out chat bot. If you recall from our report last week, we were able to successfully establish communication with OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model, and we could send and receive messages through our terminal. This week we wanted to focus these messages on the actual application of our program, and create some of the classes elaborated on in our specification document to facilitate this process. A Subject class was created which will be the parent class of all specific subjects, and contain all methods of said derived classes. This will allow for a very modular program, in which additional subjects can be easily added by deriving a new class. We created an English class to showcase the bots new functionality. In addition, we created a User class which stores a users data on which subjects they are tracking. In addition, this class contains methods to add and remove classes, as well as import and export user data using JSON.</p>
  <h2>What was Accomplished:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject class created</li>
      <li>English class created</li>
      <li>User class created</li>
      <li>Chat bot subject interaction completed</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Problems Encountered:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Structure of subject class</li>
      <li>Other coursework</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Plans to Overcome Problems:</h2>
    <p>The only real issue found in this weeks work was discussing the data types for the subject class. At one point, we had debated using a list for the subjects prompts, but elected for a dictionary in order to increase readability within the program. Other coursework kept us occupied as well, and was something to juggle on top of this weeks work.</p>
  <h2>Plans for this Week:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create remaining subject classes</li>
      <li>Further work on back end</li>

  <h1>Week 5</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This week our focus was directed towards developing the remaining subject classes and further developing the back end. Geography, History, and ComputerScience classes were created and fleshed out to the same degree as English. Additionally, Math was completed. They currently all only have 3 prompts and breakpoints, and are worded similarly to English. Over the next week or two, we will be honing in on these prompts and breakpoints to ensure that a smooth generation is created. We additionally spent time locking down the chatbot, such that users cannot send nonsense to it. It now only accepts selections for questions. In incorporating multiple subjects into the chatbot, some changes needed to be made to User and Subject. Namely, changing the storage of classes in User from a list to a dictionary. This allows us to reference a class from user using a key value pair, where the key is the name of the subject, and the value is the class itself.</p>
  <h2>What was Accomplished:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Geography class created</li>
      <li>History class created</li>
      <li>Computer Science class created</li>
      <li>Math class completed</li>
      <li>User class edited</li>
      <li>Chatbot locked down </li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Problems Encountered:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor indexing for User.subjects</li>
      <li>Prompt specific issues</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Plans to Overcome Problems:</h2>
    <p>We redefined User.subjects into a dictionary, such that we could use the names of the subjects as keys in key value pairs. This way, we can directly address a subject instead of looping through User.subjects entirely to find a reference each time. Additionally, the prompts can sometimes generate vague answers, and create confusion. We will solve this in the coming weeks by engineering the prompts carefully.</p>
  <h2>Plans for this Week:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete APITools logic</li>
      <li>Engineer prompts that do not confuse the bot for each class</li>

  <h1>Week 6</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This week had focus on further backend improvements including, separating user input and AI, fixing our prompts to limit token usage / more concise questions and answer options, improving our math subject class, and beginning our front end design. The user will now no longer be able to put answers no longer pertaining to the question. Instead they are limited to the labeled options. The subject class no longer sends a prompt with formatting instructions, subject, and skill level. All the subject needs to do is send the subject and skill level and OpenAI will generate the question. Our math class only generates the questions and tools implemented will ensure a correct answer. Finally, the construction of our front end has started. The main menu and subject menu has been designed but lack complete functionality as of right now.</p>

  <h1>Week 9</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>The past two weeks were focused on fleshing out the front ends functionality. We began with redesigning the front end from our prototype, to a more finalized design that fits more modern user interface conventions, such as a smaller top bar, and a navigation bar for one click navigation to any page on the website. This design is substantially more user friendly, and easier to navigate when new to the website. A NavBar component was created and used in the program. Additionally, the Import and Export features were fully fleshed out in the program. This data is stored in a session, and is created in the back end using the User class defined earlier in the project. This will allow users to save their data for future uses of the program. Additionally, the Subjects page, Add Subject, and Remove Subject features have all been added and completed. This allows the users to visually track the progress of their subjects, add new subjects, and remove subjects from their tracking. These are obviously integral features, and having them up and running allows for very easy testing of the next phases of the program. Additionally, further work was done to the Math child class to smoothly implement into the program when it is complete</p>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>With this week, our focus was directed towards the study page. With this page being implemented, the question and answer communication demonstrated in our class demos from weeks prior is now online, and usable through the website. This is a massive chunk of our program, and the main deliverable which was promised in our design documents, and is thus something to be celebrated for coming online. Most of the work was done in creating the class demos in weeks prior, so all that really needed to be done was translating it to this client server call and response functionality. Additionally, some quality of life changes were added to the website. A loading page was added to the websites landing page such that when the client is connecting to the API, they cannot make requests to it until it has already connected. The subjects page was also cleaned up after feedback from last week to hopefully improve clarity of use for users.</p>

  <h1>Week 11</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This week, a few main goals were accomplished. To begin, part of the flashcards page was created. Users can now save questions generated in Study to a flashcard. These flashcards are stored in their saved data, and can be accessed in Flashcards. These flashcards are grouped by subject, and allow the user to go back and review questions they specifically chose to save. This is not exactly fitting our design document, but we believe it to be a substantially more valuable addition to the program. The legacy flashcards feature will be added next week. Additionally, the subjects prompts were tweaked to allow for more engaging levels of difficulty. Computer Science benefits the most from this, given its wide range of topics. Finally, some more work for Math was completed. Math will have the AI generate the expressions in a format that can be displayed in markdown, and sent to sympy to be solved / verified. All in all, a majority of the website is completed at this point. The remaining time will be dedicated to implementing math, implementing the legacy flashcards feature, and further tweaking of AI prompting.</p>
  <h2>What was Accomplished:</h2>
    <ul>

    <ul>
      <li>How to display math problems</li>

  <h2>Plans to Overcome Problems:</h2>
    <p>Math problems are a little unique, and must be displayed a certain way due to their use of symbols. We will be working around this by displaying a markdown renderer on the web page, and placing the math expressions inside of it.</p>
