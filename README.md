# What is AI Study Companion?

AI Study Companion (ASC) is a collaborative project spawned from PennWest California's Senior Project: Software Engineering course.  
This project is headed by four Computer Science students of PennWest California:

- Cameron Calhoun  
- Gage Keslar  
- Jonathan Buckel  
- Seth Morgan

AI Study Companion is a website built to utilize the latest large language model capabilities to provide a convenient solution to studying given subjects. AI Study Companion provides users with a set of subjects in which they can interactively test their skills in, with ASC adjusting the difficulty based on your individual progress.
